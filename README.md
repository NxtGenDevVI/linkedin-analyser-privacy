LinkedIn Analyser ("we," "us," or "the Extension") provides professional profile insights directly within your browser. We value your privacy and are committed to transparency regarding any data accessed during your use of the Extension.
2. Information We Access and Collect

To provide profile analysis, the Extension accesses the following information:

    Website Content: The Extension reads professional information visible on LinkedIn profile pages (e.g., job titles, skills, and experience) only when the user initiates an analysis.

    User-Provided Data: If the Extension requires an API key (e.g., OpenAI) or user preferences, these are provided voluntarily by the user.

3. How We Use Your Data

In compliance with the Google Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, we declare the following:

    Single Purpose: Data is used exclusively to provide professional analysis and insights to the user.

    No Remote Storage: All analysis is performed locally or via direct API calls. We do not store your data, LinkedIn profile details, or browsing history on any external servers owned by the developer.

    No Sale of Data: We never sell, rent, or trade user data to third parties, data brokers, or advertising networks.

4. Storage and Security

    Local Storage: User settings and temporary analysis results are stored using the chrome.storage API. This data remains on your local device.

    Encryption: Any data transmitted (e.g., to an AI analysis model) is sent via secure HTTPS connections.

5. Permissions Justification

The Extension requests the following permissions to function:

    hostPermissions (linkedIn.com): Necessary to read the professional profile data you wish to analyze.

    storage: Necessary to save your preferences and history locally on your machine.
